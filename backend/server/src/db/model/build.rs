//! Data structures for a derivation build.
//!
//! A derivation build is the process of realizing a derivation in the Nix store to check if it
//! builds successfully. Each build attempt is uniquely identified by a [`DrvBuildId`].
//!
//! For each attempt to build a derivation a new [`DrvBuildMetadata`] entry is stored in the
//! database.
//!
//! During the build process several [`DrvBuildEvent`] entries are inserted into the database. The
//! latest of these entries is the current build status.
